Increasing leaders are faced with making decisions in unprecedented or highly uncertain situations. The pandemic illustrated those conditions where leaders in all sectors needed to respond without having all the data they would like and knowing that their context could change rapidly. Often leaders are asked later to defend these decisions and explain their decision-making processes.
There are risks to organisations when their leaders are paralysed by the risks inherent in uncertainty, or alternatively when they rush to solve when feeling under pressure.
There are systematic approaches for making decisions in conditions of uncertainty, and tools and techniques which can help leaders improve their process. This one-day program will use a simple simulation to introduce participants to a method grounded in decision science they can use to add rigour to their decision making, and to help others think logically under",001AD00000U2kX5YAJ,001AD00000U2kX1YAJ,,,Yes,No LMS,,,0128q0000004KoxAAE,,,2019-01-01,,,,,,6.5,"Participants will be in roles where their decisions have consequence for their work area, broader organisation or for the community.
