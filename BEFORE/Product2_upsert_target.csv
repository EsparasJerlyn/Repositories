"There are two aspects to this project:

1.)	Online course production: QLD Health have created the content, but they are seeking Karen’s support to provide strategic direction, content advice and approval. The non-award learning design team will then develop the online course and provide QLD Health with a SCORM file. QLD Health will be paying $40,000 for this part of the project.
2.)	Once the online course is ready, it will be marketed through the QUTeX site. The course is priced at $120 per person and SoN will receive 100% of revenue from course registrations – we might receive 10 enrolments, or we might receive 500! This course will sit on the QUTeX site for a term of two years. Given QLD Health’s involvement, they are keen to receive 6 monthly reports which will cover off on general course feedback, etc. Karen is responsible for compiling these reports and sending them through to the client.

"Develop a short course for migrants with qualifications in Education that provides an overview of the teaching profession in Australia. The course can be offered in face-to-face and online modes. The target audience would be migrants with non-school qualifications in Education. Such a course can create a nurturing environment for these teachers. It can focus on teacher registration requirements in different states, expectations of education jurisdictions (e.g. AITSL, ACARA), Australian school types, classroom pedagogies, classroom management, assessment and reporting, pathways for further professional learning, etc. Successful overseas teachers would also be invited to share their stories. Through a community of practice, these teachers will be encouraged to volunteer and act as role models and mentors for the migrant teachers  .",,01tOm0000036lovIAA,false,CIESJ: CPE Migrant Teacher CPE
"The audience would be people within healthcare who have a desire to enter or have a current role in patient safety and quality improvement/innovation (from frontline practitioners to senior leaders). I have quite a large global network in this field so I know the market well. The offering (which could take a range of forms but would typically be short courses and perhaps a scaffolded certification program) would be entirely built by myself and a small number of faculty subject matter experts.
