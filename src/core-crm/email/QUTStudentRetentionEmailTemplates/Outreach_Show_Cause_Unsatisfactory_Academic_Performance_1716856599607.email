      <ul style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14.5px;">
       <li>Your GPA has been less than 3 in consecutive teaching periods other than in the first 96 credit points of your course;</li>
       <li>You have failed a unit three (3) or more times; or you have failed a designated unit two (2) times;</li>
       <li>You have exceeded the maximum time limit for your course; or</li>
       <li>You have failed to meet the requirements of your higher research degree candidature.</li>
      </ul> <p style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14.5px;">Take some time to understand which category you fall into and what circumstances may have contributed to this outcome.</p> <p style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14.5px;"><b>The letter you received is informing you that you are eligible for exclusion should you fail to appeal, or your appeal is dismissed.</b> This can be challenging to work through on your own so, we've outlined some practical steps, below, to help you appeal the decisions that may result in an exclusion from your current course.</p>
      <ol style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14.5px;">
       <li>Understand what this all means - it can be difficult to work out what this all means for you, especially if you are feeling disappointed or vulnerable during the process. Take the time to <a href="https://qutguild.com/academic-advocacy/exclusion-or-show-cause/">inform yourself</a>.</li>
       <li>Take note of the dates in your letter in which to lodge your appeal and submit before the due date - this is essential! If you are unable to submit your appeal by the final deadline.</li>
       <li>Familiarise yourself with the format to 'Appeal against unsatisfactory academic performance'. The QUT Guild Academic Advocacy team</li>
       <li>Seek assistance with preparing your appeal. The QUT Guild can assist you with <a href="https://qutguild.com/academic-advocacy/">Academic Advocacy Help</a>. Details regarding how to make an appointment with the Guild are listed towards the end of this message.</li>
       <li>Take some time to reflect on the circumstances that may have impacted on your studies; collect supporting documents; prepare your draft appeal early so you have time to prepare the best possible case.</li>
       <li>&nbsp;</li>
      </ol> <p style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14.5px;">Most importantly, <b>ask for help</b>. While it's common to be a bit uncomfortable asking questions, all students will have them! Don't be afraid to ask for help.</p> <p style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14.5px;"><a href="https://unihub.qut.edu.au/Form.aspx?id=4017174">Contact</a> the <b>Student Success Team</b>.
