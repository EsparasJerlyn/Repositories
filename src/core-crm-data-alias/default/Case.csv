Hi Vasiti,

It’s exciting to hear that you are considering furthering your knowledge in urban planning with QUT!

To clarify, may I ask if you are wanting to complete a Bachelor of Built Environment (Honours) (AB01)<https://www.qut.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-built-environment-honours>? Are you looking for advice on how best to apply for this course considering your previous grades?

If you confirm that you are wanting to study a full course at QUT, I will forward your enquiry to the appropriate team who can answer your questions. Alternatively, if you are a current student at an overseas institution and would like to study one or two semesters of your course at QUT, I can assist you.

Hi Sakshi,

Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Morgan and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.

I was unable to find an application under your name or email address. If your agent has submitted an application, please ask them for your application ID.

Without an active application, you cannot ‘change your agent’. Instead, you will need to contact an authorised QUT agent who will be able to submit an application on your behalf.

To find an authorised QUT agent, search our database<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/international/find-a-representative> for representatives in your country.

I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!BgXStCy9oeAPkA2PvJtMrNkb4_ctXzUp7H2iSgbQG7CY2D2Ql9XiTnWbbV11p0twT10Icyx6onQb-6CLetd0kQoasVS_womS$>.

Dear The Queensland University of Technology Admissions Committee,



I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide an update and seek clarification regarding my application status with Queensland University of Technology (QUT). My name is Sakshi Sonar, and I recently applied through an agent, Sheetal Mare, to pursue my academic aspirations at QUT.



However, there have been certain developments and concerns during this process that have led me to consider a change in representation. I wanted to communicate this change to you directly and ensure that my application remains unaffected.



I have been working with Sheetal Mare to apply to QUT. While they assured me that my application was submitted, I have not received any response or confirmation from the university for approximately one month. Additionally, I have been informed that Gradstar Consultant is not an authorized agent for QUT and that they are in contact with another authorized agency Krushna Consultant to facilitate the application process. Moreover, I am not sure if agent actually submitted my application. These circumstances have raised doubts about the progress and reliability of my application.



To ensure the smooth and legitimate processing of my application, I have decided to change my agent and work with an authorized representative of QUT. My intention in doing so is to maintain the integrity of my application profile and ensure that it aligns with QUT's policies and standards.



I want to emphasize that my decision to change agents is not a reflection of my commitment to QUT or my academic pursuits. Rather, it is a measure to guarantee the accuracy and authenticity of my application. I would like to request your guidance on how to proceed with this agent change while safeguarding my application status and profile.



If this agent change will impact my application or if any specific procedures need to be followed, please provide the necessary instructions. I am fully prepared to cooperate with all requirements and provide any additional information needed to facilitate this transition smoothly.



I appreciate your understanding of my situation and your assistance in ensuring that my application to QUT is handled correctly and in compliance with your policies.



Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your guidance and a swift resolution.



Sincerely,

Sakshi Sonar

Hi Atufa,

Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Morgan and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.

Our portal is open all year round, so you can apply at any time and applications can take up to 30 days for assessment.

We recommend applying at least 4 months in advance of the start date to allow enough time for applying for a visa (if required).

The application closing date for students not in Australia is typically 4 weeks before the start of classes. For Semester 1, 2024 this date is 22 January 2024.

I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!HdwsxEW4wVlDCGRb9l-4u0caPtnSkEYBKKO_xMO0DWynId7wFBNSiPKAAFkBwzIY0UbKc2-ix02Qw3LVDW_OfixoYQ$>.

Hi Amna,

Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Morgan and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.

International Student Visa holders cannot get an offer to study online and are required to comply with the requirements of their visas. This often requires the completion of the degree to be in-person. For more information regarding visa-related matters please contact the Department of Home Affairs<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/contact-us__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!G4_qXHaiMz9B-7cfH95ecQS-0G8D9fg1_SrP1kqi-w8oxWhGkNBCPv2z3KgHg4FyPzBX9eTHZQ7gMCYvEYzm41UKoA$>.

Subject: Online Distance Learning Top-Up Inquiry

Dear Vine,



I hope this communication finds you in good health. My name is Amna, and I am presently exploring my educational choices. I stumbled across your wonderful post about your QUT experience and was blown away by your adventure.

I'm especially interested in pursuing a top-up degree via online distance learning, and I have some concerns about QUT's options in this area. Given your favorable experience with the institution, I feel you may have insightful information to give.

Could you kindly provide me information regarding QUT's online distance learning programs, particularly those in business and marketing? I'm excited to look into chances that will enable me to use my skills in real-world settings, similar to what you stated.

I recognize that studying abroad is a big choice, and I would appreciate any advise or help you can provide to someone thinking about it. Your knowledge and viewpoint would be useful in assisting me in making an educated choice.

Thank you ahead of time for your time and help. I eagerly await your response.

Best wishes,

Amna

Let me tell you about my experience.

Hi AMNA,

My name is Vine and two years ago I was right where you are now – deciding which university to trust with my future.

After receiving offers to study at three different universities, I was struggling to choose which one to accept. There were so many factors to consider like educational culture and areas of expertise, so after researching and asking lots of questions to all three universities, I chose QUT – the university for the real world.

During my two years studying at QUT, I was constantly impressed by how QUT emphasised opportunities that integrated knowledge and learnings into real, high-quality practical applications. Each project or assessment was grounded and embedded with real-world examples, giving real insight into how companies and organisations worked to solve challenges.

But it’s not all about study. I have also worked part-time in hospitality and retail, explored Brisbane, and made lots of friends. The experiences I have gained have helped me to become more independent and confident.

I understand that making the decision to study overseas is a big decision, but it’s also a brave one. My advice? Step outside your comfort zone and challenge yourself.

Best wishes on your journey to QUT!

Respected Morgan

                                I am thankful to QUT in taking care to respond to a person who is in mess from all sides

I suppose the contact numbers  provided for Home Affairs are from the Landline or Cell phone. Means I may not be able to use the WhatsApp .  I will inform  the Uni, what soever is the outcome

In any manner I can only plead for a Offer Letter from QUT with little more scholarships ,in future. And consideration of my case ,on human grounds.  My then forthcoming performance once if I join with course in all regards will be the basic criteria along with the factors laid down by QUT. But at this stage it's  a purely Utopian dream.

If you are little more considerate. I am daring to request you about information about the allotment of lectures , classes ,tutorials & laboratories are provided to the regular students  either in first half , or second half respectively or some of the contents in first half the others in second half. Or is the discretion of the Roster.

Though Uni  will be using Its discretion in providing me the Offer letter.  After going through my Academic Transcripts

Because I need to justify my ground for studies at the mature age apart from the financial viability.

 At the same time in VISA rejection letter in 2009. I suppose DIMA at that time was very unhappy, with all that happened. And has cancelled the visa as I remained not the regular student & at the same time overstaying  in India. And has categorically suggested about my visa filling applications  in future.

I will without hesitation contact the related points i.e USQ, ETI Perth &  Department of Home Affairs. Or may suggest me other any other agency, sort of a Students Guild taking up matters with little more considerations.

As I am not in any contact with  any Educational Consultant. Please do suggest me the link wherein I can check the other requirements to get the permit to study or its viability. For my application. I am trying to search the link for something like AAERAI approved consultants but in vain.  Or your approved agents in Delhi or the link.

Once again thanks for the cooperation . If feasible do respond to my queries.

Regards

Sanjeev Bakshi

Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Morgan and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.

Unfortunately, QUT cannot provide advice on applications to other universities such as USQ, or the Department of Home Affairs.

Student's message       Dear Queensland University of Technology, It is my gratitude to write on you seeking for a scholarship in your university. I graduated my Bachelor of Business Administration Major in Marketing Management here in the Philippines at PHINMA CAGAYAN DE ORO COLLEGE a proud scholar of this institute. PHINMA CAGAYAN DE ORO COLLEGE is a well known here in the Philippines because they provide a high quality education. Other than that I'm seeking for this scholarship to grant on my request as it was very necessary for me to continue my study with your great organization.We are a poor family here in the Philippines, I'm seeking for a good opportunity to work harder to reach my family goal. I will never missed the opportunity you will be given to me. I will work harder just you to see that I'm worthy. I know you will receive many scholarship applications. I hope you will consider my application and allow me to fulfill my dream. Yours Truly, Crismarie Gilles

Hi
I am currently studying nursing undergraduate at Cyprus International University. I am interested in applying for Queensland University of Technology's BSN program.

I have a question regarding the entry requirements. In the website's entry requirements qualification list my qualifications are not listed.
I have completed Fiji Year 12 Certificate examination in 2018 and I am currently studying an undergraduate bachelors of nursing. I have currently completed 41 credits (60 ECTS). I would like to know whether I meet the entry requirement.

Also, does the University accept TOEFL iBT Home edition.

Furthermore, since my academic transcripts are from an overseas university, do I have to get my transcripts certified or accredited? If so, which institution's accreditations does Queensland University of Technology accept?

Thank you for your time and consideration.",TRUE,2024-05-29T10:08:12.000+0034,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,Fiji,<p>Prospective international student - offshore</p><p><br></p>,,,Onshore & Pacific,,Course information,Response Given,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,Placements

Hi.

My name is Abdeel and I applied and got an offer for the course master of social work -qualifying. I am in the process of sorting out my finances for the sake of the visa application.

I have not paid the deposit but hopefully I will be doing that at the end of the month. If by chance I am not able to pay for the Feb intake. Is there a July intake?

I really have been dreaming of going of being in that class this February 26th. And I have faith that this will happen

Sincerely yours

   I, the student/ ALENEZI, SUDA ALHUMAIDI M,
 inform you that I applied to your prestigious university to study for a master's degree in Business Administration t, and I attached all the required documents and obtained conditional acceptance from you in the language, knowing that I have eight years of experience in managing international schools, and All my dealings with students, parents and officials at the Ministry of Education were all in English. I also had one year of management experience at King Salman Hospital. I dealt with nursing staff of all nationalities. All dealings were in English. I also informed you that my university studies were in English. The university's accredited language was English. The assessment and tests were all in English.
 Therefore, I ask you to consider my case and give me the opportunity to obtain direct and unconditional admission, as I do not want to waste a year of my life studying the language, and I am capable of that and capable of starting the master’s journey. I promise, God willing, that I shall be among the outstanding students in studying for the master’s degree, because I have confidence in my capabilities and abilities . I am completely confident that your prestigious university shall enable me to do this, so I ask you to give me the opportunity to begin my studies, as I obtained a scholarship paid for by the Ministry of Education and was nominated for the King Salman Foreign Scholarship Program based on my abilities, skills and experience, as I obtained first place in many Local and international awards, which played a major role in my nomination and obtaining the scholarship.
Therefore, I ask you to help me achieve my dream of completing the study of Business Administration at your prestigious university.

 I previously attached to you my experiences in an International School, my university study letter by English Language, C. V. and some supporting documents .

With much appreciation, respect and thanks .

Dear Sir/ Madam,

Thank you so much for the unconditional offer as a golden opportunity in studying in QUT.

I am writing to make an inquiry on the areas below.

1. Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC)
- Please revise my option of USHC ""I am organising my own OSHC"", and provide support on the application of OSHC.

2. Scholarship
- Please reconsider offering me an International Merit Scholarship. It is because I do receive a 25% scholarship from other universities for the same course.

I would be grateful if you could kindly reply at your earliest convenience.

Let me tell you about my experience.
Hi Gena,

My name is Vine and two years ago I was right where you are now – deciding which university to trust with my future.

After receiving offers to study at three different universities, I was struggling to choose which one to accept. There were so many factors to consider like educational culture and areas of expertise, so after researching and asking lots of questions to all three universities, I chose QUT – the university for the real world.

During my two years studying at QUT, I was constantly impressed by how QUT emphasised opportunities that integrated knowledge and learnings into real, high-quality practical applications. Each project or assessment was grounded and embedded with real-world examples, giving real insight into how companies and organisations worked to solve challenges.

But it’s not all about study. I have also worked part-time in hospitality and retail, explored Brisbane, and made lots of friends. The experiences I have gained have helped me to become more independent and confident.

I understand that making the decision to study overseas is a big decision, but it’s also a brave one. My advice? Step outside your comfort zone and challenge yourself.

Best wishes on your journey to QUT!

Vine

Respected Sir

                          I request to enquire that for applying for a Bachelor's or Masters Course in QUT , Brisbane as an International mathure student (DOB is 16/4/1969) from India would be a Bottleneck .
. When the student has actively studied Bachelor's in law and Commerce from  India . And has achieved 7 Bands in Academic regularly , but now needs recertification. In the last 10 years.

I have shown my permanant intention of keeping the fees with Education Trainning Institute for more than 10 years Perth. And was not able to file for Visa application because of some problem on his lease hold property.

When asking from one of your Educational Accredited Representatives of your University.  It clearly stated  plane  'no' in getting the Students permission to study in Australia from the Australian Government. Inspite of a Offer Letter

Please let me inform of the ground reality in this bleak scenario. I have earlier send a query to Mr. Morgan & got a very positive clear answer from him.

Thanking you

I have Permanant Resident status, I'm not on a student visa. Will this allow me to access part time and online study options?

I'm also finding it difficult to work out entry requirements - I'm certain I qualify for most courses, but I don't know how to map my UK qualifications to the Australian system.

Thanks for your help.

Hi Pete,



Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Morgan and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.



To explore the study options<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/international> available at QUT, head to our webpage. I have also attached the International Course Guide to help you decide which course is best for you.



International Student Visa holders cannot get an offer to study online/part-time and are required to comply with the requirements of their visas. This often requires the completion of the degree to be in-person and full-time. For more information regarding visa-related matters please contact the Department of Home Affairs<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/contact-us__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!GLYdclUr_kJDe2GO6vnbyDgfHkXGN3ZhPZG63Gc_xL2JRJEtkzIn2FnJv17GJ7Ufpu1CGlbVMgiPme9Sqtd-p-AcCg$>.



I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!GLYdclUr_kJDe2GO6vnbyDgfHkXGN3ZhPZG63Gc_xL2JRJEtkzIn2FnJv17GJ7Ufpu1CGlbVMgiPme9SqtdSnyVWvw$>.

Hi Yingtai,

Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Morgan and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.

We reached out the Faculty of Creative Industries, who provided the following response:

It would be difficult to provide an exhaustive list as the equipment kits get quite complex as the Film students’ progress through the degree.

The key pieces of equipment that might be relevant would be as follows:

Key Cameras in each year of study

1st Year – Sony AX53 / Sony X70 & Panasonic CX350
2nd Year – Panasonic AU-EVA1 35mm
3rd Year – Panasonic VariCam LT

Audio

Bespoke Sennheiser, Sound Devices and Lectrosonics sound kits tailored for each unit.

Lighting, Grip, etc

A range of Arri, Kino & Aputure lighting set for individual units needs. Substantial grip holdings to support student shoots (Matthews Dollies, Manfrotto & Avenger).

Students will additionally gain access to the large multicamera TV Studio & Virtual Production Studio, details of which can be found on the Virtual Tours link below.

https://www.qut.edu.au/about/campuses-and-facilities/virtual-tours

I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!C71lbsrW2pTqJqnsxbYXt2MHeyCUx8nDW068YQg3LFpuRpKV2uiHXCn7zMj8jfXGapHivimSlzSigte_9xkPRESoyOw$>.

Hi
I'm interested in Master of information technology , business process management
As the course is of 2 years
But we can reduce it upto 1.5 years as the modules of 1st semester are already covered in my bachelors degree ...

But the problem is my consultant said if the course is for 1.5 years , you won't get 5 years work permit , you'll need to do 2 years course to get work permit

So I'm confused , can you clarify a bit .

Thanks in advance

Let me tell you about my experience.
Hi Scott,

My name is Vine and two years ago I was right where you are now – deciding which university to trust with my future.

After receiving offers to study at three different universities, I was struggling to choose which one to accept. There were so many factors to consider like educational culture and areas of expertise, so after researching and asking lots of questions to all three universities, I chose QUT – the university for the real world.

During my two years studying at QUT, I was constantly impressed by how QUT emphasised opportunities that integrated knowledge and learnings into real, high-quality practical applications. Each project or assessment was grounded and embedded with real-world examples, giving real insight into how companies and organisations worked to solve challenges.

But it’s not all about study. I have also worked part-time in hospitality and retail, explored Brisbane, and made lots of friends. The experiences I have gained have helped me to become more independent and confident.

I understand that making the decision to study overseas is a big decision, but it’s also a brave one. My advice? Step outside your comfort zone and challenge yourself.

Best wishes on your journey to QUT!

Vine

Greetings from Taiwan and the OH! Study Education Center!

I am writing to you concerning the upcoming 2024 Spring Overseas Education Expo from March 16th to the 20th in Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung and Hsinchu (https://ohstudy.net/expo<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://ohstudy.net/expo__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!Cd4GHzOFM2WOAvnR409Tm9_f64nU8nWyxAiyKY2Vp7yfNhPDoFY2I7U97dspyj3cV3TXthCTaTNsZuG9fL_v$>).

We are expecting well over 100 institutions to participate in the expo, and it will be five major promotional theme for the event.


  1.  Work and career development opportunities during and after overseas education programs.
  2.  A special focus on undergraduate and community college/polytechnic programs
  3.  Everything related to AI and robotics
  4.  Summer programs
  5.  Academic language and test prep programs

More information about these promotions will become available as we get closer to the spring event.  However, we welcome you to contact us to discuss ways we can better promote your school through one of these themes (or even others) during our spring event.

OH! Study consistently hosts the largest overseas education fairs in Taiwan, and is able to attract the largest number of high-quality students through a comprehensive promotions strategy.  We sincerely hope, you will be able to join us in the spring for what promises to be a dynamic and large-scale event.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me or our event management team at expo@ohstudy.net<mailto:expo@ohstudy.net>. We look forward to hosting you in the spring!

Best regards,

Brian Hockertz
President
OH! Study Education Center

Special Note from the President – Conflicting Events
It has come to our attention that other organizations have decided to host their spring exhibitions on the same dates as ours.  While we encourage robust and innovative competition, and we respect everyone’s right to conduct their own business, we are concerned this move may be counterproductive and put several of our partnered schools in difficult positions. OH! Study holds its Taipei event in the largest venue in the city, and as such, we must book and pay deposits well over a year in advance, and we announce our dates a year in advance, too. If for whatever reason you are unable to attend our events, we would still be happy to work with you and promote your school and its programs. Of course, if you are able to attend our event, we will be able to more actively promote you.",TRUE,2024-05-29T10:08:12.000+0140,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,<p>spam</p>,,,China & Mongolia,,Student life,Invalid Enquiry,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,Accommodation

Dear QUT,
I am writing to ask for information about your English language requirements. I wanted to take IELTS exam this month, but this test is no longer available in my country. There are different ways to take English test as it mentioned in requirements part but unfortunately neither of them are available in Iran. 
I have looked at your website, but there is no information about Duolingo test. Could you please send me information if I can take Duolingo test instead of other ones? If the answer is yes, I would also like to know the Duolingo score you accept. 
According to the time I have to apply for this semester to begin study Project Management, I would be appreciated if you accept Duolingo English test too. 
I look forward to hearing from you.

I am an international future exchange student from Hong Kong (QUT student number: 11933046). I would like to accept the unconditional offer; however, I have some enquiries about this procedure.


Firstly, the accepting offer procedure has a question “Which Australian Embassy will you lodge your student visa application at?” but I will apply for the student visa online. Hence, I don’t know whether I should fill in Hong Kong or Australia.


Secondly, I had indicated that I was organising my own OSHC in my application. However, I would like to change the option and select and pay for the OSHC organised by QUT during the accepting offer procedure. Is it okay? Also, after I pay for the OSHC, will there be any official letter issued to me?


Thirdly, the offer letter has not mentioned that any English Language Course is required for me. Does that mean I don’t need to study English Language Course during my exchange?


I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you.



Best regards,

Cathy Ng

Dear, I am writing this letter to express my keen interest in the work study programs offered by the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). 
As a potential candidate, I am deeply excited to explore these work-study opportunities at a reputable institution such as yours.
Currently a final-year Computer Network engineering student at  New Higher School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), I am determined to deepen my learning by combining my academic studies with practical work experience.
I was impressed by QUT's reputation as a leading higher education institution and its long history of commitment to educational excellence. I am particularly interested in the work study programs at QUT because of the technology project management.
I firmly believe that this opportunity would allow me to gain valuable professional experience while continuing my academic studies.
I would like more information about the work study programs offered by QUT, including eligibility criteria, application procedures, and opportunities available in my field of study.
I would be grateful if you could direct me to any resources or provide me with details on how to apply for work study programs at QUT. Thank you for your attention to my request.

I hope this email finds you well. This is Sania tufail. I have applied at QUT more than three weeks ago in MPH Brisbane Campus. I am writing to request the status of my application as it has been more than three weeks since I applied into the program.

I understand that the university's admission process can be time-consuming, but I am in need of the offer letter to complete other essential formalities and preparations for my enrollment.As you know I have applied for feb intake and there is little time left for the preparations.  This includes securing a GTE, COE and student visa.

I kindly request your assistance in expediting the process, as time is of the essence. Your prompt response and cooperation in this matter would greatly facilitate my preparations for the upcoming academic year.

Please feel free to contact me if any additional information or documentation is required from my end to expedite this process.

Hello Morgan, I would like to understand more about how the application works, and in relation to scholarships for foreign students, would you have these types of scholarships based on the student's profile?, In this case I am looking for a scholarship for my girlfriend and for me, we came from a public school in Brazil and we are looking to improve our lives.

Hi Moises,

Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Morgan and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.

The General English Language program<https://www.qut.edu.au/courses/general-english-program-20-weeks> is not a pathway into an undergraduate program. This program will develop your proficiency through presentation and practice of relevant language content and skills in small classes. There will be interactive, task-based, student-centred activities in both simulated and authentic contexts. All coursebooks are provided to General English students as part of the course costs.

I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!HP1ZX7BG6xFN5G2zvtmFCWbHR6r7r9U87Xc0OTnuTeq1df7XOr6Wb5akarVwrfzkLSS6hrA-7h6VYrtjJ0BAOjeugHC1$>.

  1.  As mentioned on Website regrading entry requirement ""A completed recognised bachelor degree in any discipline with a minimum grade point average of 4.0 (on QUT's 7-point scale)."" Without having any academic background/experiences related IT , Is it possible to apply in this program?
  2.  For upcoming course started from Jul/2024 ,Is it possible to apply with duration of 2 years?
  3.   In case of not studying Master's degree, is it possible to apply again in the Bachelor of Information Technology even I already had a Bachelor's degree in Finance?


Appreciated your kind feedback.
Many thanks in advance.

When I applied to the Bachelor of nursing program, I was a citizen of South Korea.

Please let me know.

Hi Team,
Good Day

This is Aashish Bharadwaj Shankaran from India, QUT student ID: ""11894946"". I have applied for a Master's in Information Technology through IDP education and I also received my unconditional offer letter from your end but I do have some queries that I would like to get clarified

 1: How do I choose my major course i.e. Cyber Security and Networks? Should I choose that after coming to Australia once the course starts or I should choose it now?
Please clarify my doubt in this regard

2: I also see that there is no deadline (date) to pay my deposit fees to confirm my application and for CoE. How much time do I have to pay for my deposit fees and other fees? so that I can start the process of arranging for the money.

I have attached my application number and Unconditional offer letter
Application number: 6671389
QUT Student ID: 11894946

Dear Sir/madam,

Application No: 11876361
Student Name: Muzammil Hussain Syed
Course: Master of Professional Engineering (EN55)
Major : Civil Engineering
Intake: Autumn 2024


I hope this email finds you well. My name is Syed Muzammil Hussain, and I am writing to request a review and verification of my scholarship eligibility for the Scholarship for the upcoming academic year.


I am excited to inform you that I have met all the specified eligibility criteria for this prestigious international scholarship, including maintaining excellent academic performance with consistently high grades. However, to my surprise, I have not yet received scholarship in my offer letter.

I kindly request your assistance in reevaluating my scholarship application and verifying my profile. I believe that there may have been an oversight or some issue in the process, and I am eager to ensure that I receive the scholarship I am eligible for.

To facilitate this process, I have attached all the necessary documents and information, including my academic transcripts, recommendation letters, and any other required materials.

I am committed to continuing my academic journey and making the most of the opportunities that this scholarship would provide. Your support in reexamining my application would be greatly appreciated.

I look forward to your prompt response and hope for a positive resolution to this matter. Please feel free to reach out if you require any further information or documentation from my end.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Syed Muzammil Hussain

Respected sir/madam,

Application No: 11876361
Student Name: Muzammil Hussain Syed
Course: Master of Professional Engineering (EN55)
Major : Civil Engineering
Intake: Autumn 2024

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Syed Muzammil Hussain, and I am writing to express my gratitude for the opportunity to pursue my Masters in Professional Engineering (EN55) at Queensland University of Technology, Gardens Point. It is an honor to have been offered a place in the program.

I am excited about the prospect of studying at your esteemed institution; however, I am facing financial challenges as an international student from India. Due to the cost of tuition, living expenses, and other associated costs, it would be extremely helpful for me to secure a scholarship to support my education.

I would like to request your consideration for a scholarship to assist with the financial aspects of my studies. I believe that with the help of a scholarship, I can fully dedicate myself to my academic pursuits and make the most of the learning opportunities provided by your university.

I am committed to academic excellence and have a strong track record of performance in my previous studies. I am confident that I can contribute positively to the university community. Being granted a scholarship would make a significant difference in my ability to focus on my studies and succeed in my chosen field.

If there are any specific scholarship programs available for international students in the field of Master of Professional Engineering (EN55), I kindly request information on how I can apply or be considered for such opportunities.

I understand the competitive nature of scholarship applications and appreciate your time and consideration of my request. I am happy to provide any additional documentation or information that may be required to evaluate my candidacy for a scholarship.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to your response. Please feel free to contact me if you need any further details or have any questions.

Sincerely,

Syed Muzammil Hussain

Dear Sir or Madam,

 I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the status of my application to your esteemed institution. My application ID is: 6803402.

I submitted my application for Master of Nursing - Entry to Practice on October 18th, and according to the information provided, the decision was expected to be made within a certain timeframe. However, as that time has passed, I would appreciate any updates or insights regarding when I can expect a response.

I understand that the evaluation process may take some time due to the high volume of applications received. Nevertheless, knowing an estimated timeline would greatly assist me in planning my future academic endeavors accordingly.

If there are any additional documents or information required from my end, please let me know so that I can promptly provide them.

Thank you very much for your attention and assistance in this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Zhuowei Chen

Let me tell you about my experience.
Hi DOMINGOS,

My name is Vine and two years ago I was right where you are now – deciding which university to trust with my future.

After receiving offers to study at three different universities, I was struggling to choose which one to accept. There were so many factors to consider like educational culture and areas of expertise, so after researching and asking lots of questions to all three universities, I chose QUT – the university for the real world.

During my two years studying at QUT, I was constantly impressed by how QUT emphasised opportunities that integrated knowledge and learnings into real, high-quality practical applications. Each project or assessment was grounded and embedded with real-world examples, giving real insight into how companies and organisations worked to solve challenges.

But it’s not all about study. I have also worked part-time in hospitality and retail, explored Brisbane, and made lots of friends. The experiences I have gained have helped me to become more independent and confident.

I understand that making the decision to study overseas is a big decision, but it’s also a brave one. My advice? Step outside your comfort zone and challenge yourself.

Best wishes on your journey to QUT!

But it’s not all about study. I have also worked part-time in hospitality and retail, explored Brisbane, and made lots of friends. The experiences I have gained have helped me to become more independent and confident.

I understand that making the decision to study overseas is a big decision, but it’s also a brave one. My advice? Step outside your comfort zone and challenge yourself.

There are also faculty-specific clubs to help you with all things relevant to your degree, and associations for many countries providing support and a sense of home.

Dear Admissions Office of Queensland University,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my strong interest in the  Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (Electrical and Aerospace) program at your university. Given my family's annual income below $20,000, the application fee presents a significant financial challenge for me.

My SAT score of 1420 and a TOEFL score of 101. Additionally, I have attached my school report and passport photo as part of the application materials. I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to study at your institution and believe that the Engineering programs offered align perfectly with my career aspirations.

I kindly request your consideration for an application fee waiver, which would greatly assist me in applying to your university without the burden of the fee. Your support in this matter would be sincerely appreciated.

Thank you for your time and attention to my request.

Sincerely,

We trust this message finds you well.

We are conducting a large-scale investigation about peer review practices in social sciences across the world, and we would like to invite you to participate to our survey.

The survey
In particular, in this survey we are interested in your personal experience and opinions about the way peer review for scientific articles is currently implemented in your discipline. Who reviews what, when, and how? Who is (not) invited to review? We are interested in your opinions even if you have never been invited to peer review an article. The survey should take approximately 20 minutes to complete. All data will be processed anonymously, and your contact and personal information will not be made available in any shape or form.

Participant selection
We have sampled participants, including yourself, following a stratified multi-stage procedure: in fifty countries, we have selected 10 universities per country and then identified scholars working in any social sciences department (broadly understood) based on publicly available information on these universities’ websites.

General project
This survey is part of a broader multi-year research project looking at multiple aspects of peer review in social sciences, being undertaken by a team of scholars in eight countries. More information can be found on the project’s website<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.peerreviewstudy.com__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!DGXUMdXOUWG9q5O80nlxMhd6DjzcZMkFyWEc5Azjluh2VaymOqte6HPz361mzQ9BmKaZKxuPpghv5ab0mREFUYO3IA$>.

Hi Guys,

Good morning.

I have been through your website to find information regarding your 4 Year Engineering programme in Computer Science where the central area of subject being Artificial Intelligence.
This is for my nephew, who is completing his secondary school in Bahrain.   His academic term ends in June 2024 and we would like to consider an intake after that, allowing us sufficient time for the required formalities and visa processing.

As we search we come across a variety of courses with differing fees.  Therefore we seek comprehensive and precise guidance on the options available to us in terms of our given choice.

A clear information with links if any is appreciated.

Thanks and cheers.

Let me tell you about my experience.

Hi Malavika,

My name is Vine and two years ago I was right where you are now – deciding which university to trust with my future.

After receiving offers to study at three different universities, I was struggling to choose which one to accept. There were so many factors to consider like educational culture and areas of expertise, so after researching and asking lots of questions to all three universities, I chose QUT – the university for the real world.

During my two years studying at QUT, I was constantly impressed by how QUT emphasised opportunities that integrated knowledge and learnings into real, high-quality practical applications. Each project or assessment was grounded and embedded with real-world examples, giving real insight into how companies and organisations worked to solve challenges.

But it’s not all about study. I have also worked part-time in hospitality and retail, explored Brisbane, and made lots of friends. The experiences I have gained have helped me to become more independent and confident.

I understand that making the decision to study overseas is a big decision, but it’s also a brave one. My advice? Step outside your comfort zone and challenge yourself.

Best wishes on your journey to QUT!

Vine
Master of Business (Marketing), China

Hi Jimena,

Great to hear from you again! My name is Alie and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.

Our portal is open all year round, so you can apply at any time and applications can take up to 30 days for assessment.

We recommend applying at least 4 months in advance of the start date to allow enough time for applying for a visa (if required).

The application closing date for students not in Australia is typically 4 weeks before the start of class. The 2025 deadlines have not yet been confirmed.

I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!HMUke0ZdNr0D53yof8vSCSZytk_U9WuWqE-EP7pz7Y1rTKP0KIQGohmIsqm82kGiYpGd0MrrP5MfO8XeWDkfRc7H$>.

My name is Ruby Lee, and I am a current year 11 student that is interested in studying climate science at QUT. I would love to do a double degree with this course, preferably in communications, majoring in journalism. When I looked at the page for the Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Communication (journalism), I noticed that climate science is not one of the options to major in with communications.
I was just wondering if this will become an option in the future, or if this is not something I am able to pursue in the future.

Thank you for your time.

Hi Chirag,

Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Morgan and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.

Our Master of Business<https://www.qut.edu.au/courses/master-of-business?international> commences in February and July of each academic year and runs for 1.5 - 2 years full-time from our Gardens Point campus. The annual international tuition fee is approximately $34,000 (2023 AUD fees).

To view the entry requirements<https://www.qut.edu.au/courses/master-of-business?international#requirements>, visit the course page and scroll down to the ‘Explore this course’ section and click on the ‘Requirements’ tab.

  *   1.5 year program: A completed recognised bachelor degree in business or related field with a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 4.00 (on QUT's 7 point scale).
  *   2 year program: A completed recognised bachelor degree in any discipline with a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 4.00 (on QUT's 7 point scale).

If you are unsure whether you meet these entry requirements, we would encourage you to still apply for this course and our international admission team will assess your eligibility once you have submitted a formal application. We cannot pre-assess qualifications.

Credit for prior learning
To be considered for credit towards your QUT course and be able to graduate sooner, you will need to include additional supporting documents with your application. This includes:


  *   your official academic transcript showing the unit code(s), unit title(s) and grade(s) achieved
  *   documents proving that you have completed your course, such as a completion certificate
  *   unit outlines or course syllabus of the unit(s) you are wanting credit for.

There is a question within the application called “Do you wish to be considered for Advanced Standing based on your previous studies?”. You will need to select ‘Yes’ to this question.

Once you have finished and submitted your application, our international admission team will consider your request for advanced standing. Details of the credit awarded and the potential reduction in course duration will be listed in your QUT offer letter. We cannot pre-assess credit – you must apply to QUT with your supporting documents for consideration.

You can search for previously approved units<https://www.advancedstanding.qut.edu.au/cgi-bin/WebObjects/AdvStand.woa> for credit on the Advanced Standing Precedent List.

Scholarships
All international applicants are automatically considered for the International Merit Scholarship (IMS) once an application has been submitted. The IMS award offers a 25% reduction in tuition fees for the first year of your course at QUT.

For eligible courses only, an ongoing award of 25% per semester may be offered to students who continue to meet the GPA requirement.

For more information, please visit the International Merit Scholarship<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/fees-and-scholarships/scholarships/international-merit-scholarship> webpage.

Applying to QUT
You must apply to QUT via an authorised QUT representative (agent). To find an agent, search our database<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/international/find-a-representative> for representatives in your country. An agent can assist you with your application, eligibility and supporting documents and answer any questions you may have about studying at QUT.

You will need to include all your supporting documents including:

  *   High school completion certificate / academic transcripts and records
  *   English language proficiency test results
  *   Passport identity page

I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!BSmu6MAfp6_F_isTiQb3Y86S4rNnGtmagB_Vh8n0I7--H8MkZ0OD1LoHpGdnd2AcsnzkP5YE-93q_fKJXvEHSUFMcGwmEL9V$>.

My name is Lu-nung, Chiang (student number:11927747)

I am genuinely thrilled to have received an offer from QUT, which is my dream university. Currently, I find myself in a significant dilemma. The University of Western Australia (UWA) offers me a $10,000 scholarship annually, and Griffith University offers a 25% tuition fee reduction. These offers are undeniably attractive, especially for me and my family's financial situation.

However, in comparison, I have a stronger preference for the warm climate of Brisbane, the campus culture at QUT, the practicality of the courses, and the industry recognition of QUT. Therefore, I would like to inquire if there is a possibility of receiving a partial scholarship from QUT.

(My undergraduate GPA is 3.55 out of 4 with an average of 83.67).

I am committed to showcasing my best self in the coming two years.
Thank you for your consideration and I am looking forward to your response.

Thank you and my sincerest blessings,

Respected Sir/Maam,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Anna Grace Jomon, and I recently submitted my application for the Master of Social Work (MSW) program through Abe Services, as I am eager to pursue my studies at Queensland University of Technology.

I am well aware that the application process may take time, but it has been two weeks since I turned in all the required documents. I am writing to kindly inquire about the status of my application and request more information on the standard duration for receiving a response. For me, receiving the offer letter on time is essential because it starts the next steps in getting an education loan. I would thus be very grateful for any information on the present status of my application.

Thank you for your time and consideration to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,
Anna Grace Jomon

Queensland University Of Technology

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to shoot you an email to let you know how interested I am in studying fashion-related pattern making and drafting at QUT. I've got a bit of a unique background—I actually had a study gap of 13 years, but during that time, I gained some valuable experience working as a salesman at an outdoor clothing store for 5 years. After that, I took the leap and started my own manufacturing business.

I believe that QUT's Bachelor of Design (Fashion) program would be the perfect opportunity for me to enhance my skills and knowledge in garment construction, pattern making, and textile design. I'm really excited about the prospect of joining the QUT community and learning from the best in the field.

If you could provide me with more information about the program, including any admission requirements and application deadlines, I would be incredibly grateful. I'm eager to take this next step in my journey and I truly believe that QUT can help me achieve my goals.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Best regards,
Manoj Khadka

Respected Sir/Madam,

This is to request you to assist me with my application procedure for Semester 1 , Feb, 2024 for Masters of Information Technology .

My agent details are: KAAISER , Delhi , India

I had submitted my application via KAAISER on the 25th of October, 2023 and I had also received a confirmation email from QUT on 26th October, 2023 along with an application number :

‘Your application ID is: 6830043’

I could see that the current status of my application on QUT’s application portal was changed to ‘Insufficient Information ’ which I was worried about.
Hence, this is to request you to please confirm which documents are pending at our end as as far as I was told by my agent , I had submitted all the requested documents.

QUT is my first priority to enrol for Masters of Information Technology in Brisbane ,Australia as it is well known for its hands-on expertise and I want to grow and learn in an environment like yours.I would need my offer letter to proceed further with the education loan procedure and hence I have been concerned.
Please help me get through my applications procedure from here.

Hope to hear back soon

Not sure if this is the correct email to contact for this, but in my application for international exchange with QUT, I believe I chose not to apply for health insurance with QUT and to instead organize it separatley. However, could I change this on my application and include health insurance with QUT?

Subject: Re: Thank you for your enquiry about studying at QUT!

Hi, thanks for the response.

I have Permanant Resident status, I'm not on a student visa. Will this allow me to access part time and online study options?

I'm also finding it difficult to work out entry requirements - I'm certain I qualify for most courses, but I don't know how to map my UK qualifications to the Australian system.

Thanks for your help.

Pete.

Hi Pete,



Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Morgan and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.



To explore the study options<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/international> available at QUT, head to our webpage. I have also attached the International Course Guide to help you decide which course is best for you.



International Student Visa holders cannot get an offer to study online/part-time and are required to comply with the requirements of their visas. This often requires the completion of the degree to be in-person and full-time. For more information regarding visa-related matters please contact the Department of Home Affairs<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/contact-us__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!GLYdclUr_kJDe2GO6vnbyDgfHkXGN3ZhPZG63Gc_xL2JRJEtkzIn2FnJv17GJ7Ufpu1CGlbVMgiPme9Sqtd-p-AcCg$>.



I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!GLYdclUr_kJDe2GO6vnbyDgfHkXGN3ZhPZG63Gc_xL2JRJEtkzIn2FnJv17GJ7Ufpu1CGlbVMgiPme9SqtdSnyVWvw$>.

Response By Email (Bibbi) (10/11/2023 04.53 PM)


Hi Pete,

Thank you for your email, it is exciting that you want to study with us at QUT. I can certainly help you with your enquiry regarding entry requirements and study mode options.


Study mode eligibility
Since you classify as a domestic student with your permanent residency you will be able to undertake any mode of delivery that is outlined as available on the domestic students page for that course, including part-time and online mode. Just make sure to check that the course you are interested in have those delivery options available and outlined on the course page because some courses do not have that option.


Conversion of result through the application process
When you apply to an undergraduate course at QUT the application is handled by the Queensland Tertiary Admissions Office<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.qtac.edu.au/international-applications/__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!Dxuyc8qV9_loObpMTVHPa22NLUfw857Q5MdTjJOQIVbjtKI3jZM6hDhYEL3E5On6Ffb5wibDJYTHhxkGsIbbEdY$> and they convert your international results (presumably A Levels or IB in your case) into an ATAR/selection rank so that they can asses you in line with the other domestic students eligibility.

If you would like to have a look yourself we have a page called Recent secondary education<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/applying/recent-secondary-education#converting-your-results-to-a-selection-rank>, and there you can find conversion tables for all the variations of International secondary levels qualifications we accept in domestic students, and what the scores in those systems will transfer to in conversion to ATAR/selection rank.


Entry requirements
We also want to make you aware that on the domestic courses pages under the requirements tab there will be listed either 'assumed knowledge' or Prerequisites. Some of our courses have prerequisite subjects instead of, or in addition to, assumed knowledge. Prerequisites means you must have studied and met the required grade in the required subjects to gain entry to these courses. In regards to Assumed Knowledge it is important to note that not having this subject knowledge will not prevent you from gaining entry into the course. However, we recommend having the assumed knowledge so that you can be in the best position to succeed in your degree.

For information on how you can meet the assumed knowledge and whether your subjects meet the prerequisites, you may wish to see our assumed knowledge and prerequisites<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/applying/assumed-knowledge-and-prerequisites> page.

If you should find yourself in a position where you do not meet the assumed knowledge criteria, but you would like to close that knowledge gap, we encourage you to look into our QUT bridging programs<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/bridging-programs>.

Applying
Domestic applicants apply online via the Queensland Tertiary Admissions Centre (QTAC)<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.qtac.edu.au/applications/__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!Dxuyc8qV9_loObpMTVHPa22NLUfw857Q5MdTjJOQIVbjtKI3jZM6hDhYEL3E5On6Ffb5wibDJYTHhxkGGAfRBjg$>. QTAC will then assess your eligibility for the course and you may receive an offer to study at QUT. To be considered in the main offer round on the 11th of January 2024, you will need to submit your application and supporting documentation by the 8th of December 2023. The QTAC Key Dates<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.qtac.edu.au/key-dates/__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!Dxuyc8qV9_loObpMTVHPa22NLUfw857Q5MdTjJOQIVbjtKI3jZM6hDhYEL3E5On6Ffb5wibDJYTHhxkGlhgW3iQ$> page has a full list of other offer rounds and application due dates. For more information about how to apply, you may also like to refer to the QUT undergraduate applying guide<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/applying/undergraduate-guide>.



Hopefully I have answered all your enquiries, but if there’s anything else we can help you with, please reply to this email, call us on (07) 3138 2000, visit us on campus<http://www.qut.edu.au/student-centres> or start an online chat<http://www.qut.edu.au/student-centres>.

Subject: Re: Thank you for your enquiry about studying at QUT!

Hi, thanks for the response.

I have Permanant Resident status, I'm not on a student visa. Will this allow me to access part time and online study options?

I'm also finding it difficult to work out entry requirements - I'm certain I qualify for most courses, but I don't know how to map my UK qualifications to the Australian system.

Thanks for your help.

Pete.

Hi Pete,



Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Morgan and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.



To explore the study options<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/international> available at QUT, head to our webpage. I have also attached the International Course Guide to help you decide which course is best for you.



International Student Visa holders cannot get an offer to study online/part-time and are required to comply with the requirements of their visas. This often requires the completion of the degree to be in-person and full-time. For more information regarding visa-related matters please contact the Department of Home Affairs<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/contact-us__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!GLYdclUr_kJDe2GO6vnbyDgfHkXGN3ZhPZG63Gc_xL2JRJEtkzIn2FnJv17GJ7Ufpu1CGlbVMgiPme9Sqtd-p-AcCg$>.



I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!GLYdclUr_kJDe2GO6vnbyDgfHkXGN3ZhPZG63Gc_xL2JRJEtkzIn2FnJv17GJ7Ufpu1CGlbVMgiPme9SqtdSnyVWvw$>.

Let me tell you about my experience.
Hi Frederick,

My name is Vine and two years ago I was right where you are now – deciding which university to trust with my future.

After receiving offers to study at three different universities, I was struggling to choose which one to accept. There were so many factors to consider like educational culture and areas of expertise, so after researching and asking lots of questions to all three universities, I chose QUT – the university for the real world.

During my two years studying at QUT, I was constantly impressed by how QUT emphasised opportunities that integrated knowledge and learnings into real, high-quality practical applications. Each project or assessment was grounded and embedded with real-world examples, giving real insight into how companies and organisations worked to solve challenges.

But it’s not all about study. I have also worked part-time in hospitality and retail, explored Brisbane, and made lots of friends. The experiences I have gained have helped me to become more independent and confident.

I understand that making the decision to study overseas is a big decision, but it’s also a brave one. My advice? Step outside your comfort zone and challenge yourself.

Best wishes on your journey to QUT!

Vine
Master of Business (Marketing), China

Hi Sakshi,

Great to hear from you again.

This is not a valid QUT Application ID. QUT Applications ID’s will start with a 5 or a 6 and are 7 digits long.

I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!HjalWYBYzTHJzdZFkUNpy3fqA9_AkeZBxHtMfUxMRGwaRyItYJvpLYOUL8N_Lq6k52IT_DLzC6PbPOXtEvlxSG_Cb2csG31X$>.

Hi Sakshi,

Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Morgan and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.

I was unable to find an application under your name or email address. If your agent has submitted an application, please ask them for your application ID.

Without an active application, you cannot ‘change your agent’. Instead, you will need to contact an authorised QUT agent who will be able to submit an application on your behalf.

To find an authorised QUT agent, search our database<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/international/find-a-representative> for representatives in your country.

I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!BgXStCy9oeAPkA2PvJtMrNkb4_ctXzUp7H2iSgbQG7CY2D2Ql9XiTnWbbV11p0twT10Icyx6onQb-6CLetd0kQoasVS_womS$>.

Hi,

I'm inquiring about enrolling in a program for the upcoming semester in February. I'm reaching out on behalf of my brother, who is planning to enroll at QUT.

I have a couple of questions regarding his enrollment.

Firstly, my brother is interested in studying the Bachelor of Fine Art (Film, Screen, and New Media). However, his IELTS score is 6.0 overall, and his CSAT (South Korea) aggregate level is 18. Therefore, we are considering starting with a diploma in creative industries and then transferring to the Bachelor of Fine Art in the second year. Could you please confirm if the total duration of the course will still be 3 years?

Secondly, I am assisting my brother with the program application and also the visa application process. I would appreciate your advice on whether it's advisable to proceed with an agency.

Thank you for your assistance.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request the university's consideration for a waiver of the English Package ( EAP standard 2 course commencing from 20 November 2023) associated with my Bachelor's degree. While I understand the importance of language proficiency, I have a strong foundation in English, having studied it as a core subject throughout my school years.

The English courses I am currently enrolled in were necessitated by the results of an ad hoc language test, and I believe that my proficiency is sufficient for the academic demands of my chosen course. As an international student, my initial days here pose financial challenges, making it difficult to cover the additional expense of the English Package moreover, I am still not comfortable and could not adjust with the places and foods here which made my health weak.

Granting a waiver would significantly alleviate our financial strain, allowing me to focus more on my studies and contribute positively to my academic experience in Australia. I appreciate your understanding and consideration of this request.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Hi QUT,

Good day to you.

I would like to request a change of my official first given name at personal details from ""Ei the Nge"" to ""Ei The Nge”. Kindly revise letter ""T"" from a small letter to capital letter as same as with my passport, visa granted document, and offer letter.

I tried to change through HiQ, but it didn't let me go through.

Feel free to let me know if you require any supporting documents, thank you 😊

Hi Joyal,

Thank you for booking a call with us. Unfortunately, we were unable to connect with you at your booked time.

I can see that you were wanting to chat to us about your unsuccessful application.

As a university participating in the Simplified Student Visa Framework (SSVF), QUT is required to consider whether each applicant is a 'Genuine Student', motivated primarily by the intention to obtain a quality education.

The admissions team has considered your application and concluded you do not meet our genuineness requirements. Your application to study at QUT has therefore been withdrawn. Please note QUT will not reassess your eligibility on the basis of any additional information you may provide.

You are welcome to reapply to QUT after one year from the date of this email. Any application submitted before that date will result in the same decision and you will not be eligible for apply again for 12 more months.

Please direct any further queries to your agent.


Kind regards,
Alie

Student visas are usually lodged online anyway, so I don’t think it really matters which location you enter here as long as you fill this section out. It won’t impact on your offer to study at QUT.

If you must pick one and there is no Australian embassy/ consulate in your home country, you select the one closest to you. Even if this is in another country.

Hi Morgan,

Thanks for your email. I am in my final semester of a three-year Bachelor's degree in Psychology major. On reviewing the prerequisites, I've come to know that a four-year degree is required to pursue a Master's in Clinical Psychology. I would like to know if pursuing the QUT Bachelor of Behavioural Science (Hons) in Psychology program(https://www.qut.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-behavioural-science-honours-psychology) is the correct pathway for me to be eligible for a Master's program in Clinical Psychology. I look forward to your response.
Thanks in advance!

Best Regards,

Don't delay your dreams!

Start online and come when you can

Studying at QUT is one of the best decisions you'll ever make. You can start your course online in July this year (Semester 2, 2020) without delaying your career plans.

Start online and come on campus when you can.

While the Australian border is closed, we recommend you initially study online with QUT and then come to Brisbane to study on-campus when you can.

QUT innovates in response to COVID-19

While we have certainly experienced our share of disruption caused by COVID-19, Australia has fared well<http://links.realworld.qut.edu.au/ctt?ms=NjQ2ODgxODUS1&kn=3&r=MzUzNDI2NTU2NjA4S0&b=0&j=MTg4MDk1Njc2NgS2&mt=1&rt=0> compared to other developed nations, like the UK and US. Australia’s quick action, low population density and strong healthcare system has ensured our comparatively low infection and mortality rate.

QUT professors, researchers and alumni have also contributed to curbing the spread of the virus by working hard to provide innovative solutions to COVID-19-related problems. Below are some great contributions by QUT:

  *   The Creative Industries Faculty has created thousands of facemasks<http://links.realworld.qut.edu.au/ctt?ms=NjQ2ODgxODUS1&kn=31&r=MzUzNDI2NTU2NjA4S0&b=0&j=MTg4MDk1Njc2NgS2&mt=1&rt=0> using their 3D printer

Nursing alumni Yike helps out in troubled times

Bachelor of Nursing alumni Yike Gao is currently making a difference by working as a nurse at the National Corona virus Helpline. She is providing professional medical advice over the phone and educate people about COVID-19.

""My degree from QUT have provided me with strong medical knowledge and real-world experience that has been very useful. During my degree I did my work experience in an infectious disease ward at the hospital. This has given me great understanding of disease control and prevention and of how things work in a clinical setting which has been very beneficial especially in this new job.

It’s very rewarding and a privilege for me to utilise the skills I’ve learnt at university and to contribute to societies better good, says Yike.""

Hi Jimena,

Great to hear from you again! My name is Alie and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.

Our portal is open all year round, so you can apply at any time and applications can take up to 30 days for assessment.

We recommend applying at least 4 months in advance of the start date to allow enough time for applying for a visa (if required).

The application closing date for students not in Australia is typically 4 weeks before the start of class. The 2025 deadlines have not yet been confirmed.

I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!DTfR-4PSXk7g1QGQPRpoei9Tl1V-gnqyWiGdRD3bfKhbYOzrUAFVRBwV3dHJX3yQTLUFsTKVy6QL1oq9s-23S36F$>.

You’ll find a wide range of accommodation options<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/student-life/living-in-brisbane/accommodation-in-brisbane?international> to suit all budgets within walking distance to either campus. QUT has a dedicated accommodation support service<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/qut.studystays.com.au/__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!CHlKcaajZa80ZbH5aBkKUe-qOjWeU2Xs55OGqtR33Y8rZSwIQbmSo9HVUirkTMqLb6Q6F4qux7h43tG_REehMUgB$> to help you navigate the rental market and get you settled into life in Brisbane.

You can read more about Living in Brisbane<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/student-life/living-in-brisbane?international> on the website.

Hi!

My name is Jimena Suarez, I’m from Mexico.
I graduated as a mechatronics engineer two years ago, and I have been in the automotive industry for two and a half years, now I would like to apply to your
Master of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.
I have some questions about the course starts, the only date to start the course is each February?
If I’m from Mexico, Are dormitories available on campus?

Dear Sir/Ma'am,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy in the payment status for my first semester fees. On November 10th, I made a payment of 13,425 AUD with the Payment ID QUT959077293 through the Flywire portal, but the QUT application portal still reflects the payment as pending.

I kindly request your prompt assistance in rectifying this matter to ensure accurate payment status in the QUT portal. Additionally, I would appreciate your support in expediting the issuance of the electronic Confirmation of Enrolment (eCOE) to facilitate the necessary administrative processes.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance.

Best regards,

Subject: RE: Poppy, complete your profile for more tailored advice: Certificate of Business ANalyst

Hello again,

I would like to follow up on the interests of applying for Business Analyst 6months course at QUT.  I have filled some information about myself but unsure what is the next application process.  I have finish Bachelors of Business Administration and Masters Degree in Development Studies previously unsure if some courses can be credited into the course to lesson academic repetitiveness 😊

I am interested to apply as international student and would like to ensure if my application is still valuable for the QUT’s entry requirements.  I am projecting entry at the July 2024’s semester period so I would like to ensure all visa and Uni’s acceptances are inplaced.

Waiting to hear from you soonest.

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Syed Muzammil Hussain, and I am writing to request a review and verification of my scholarship eligibility for the Scholarship for the upcoming academic year.


I am excited to inform you that I have met all the specified eligibility criteria for this prestigious international scholarship, including maintaining excellent academic performance with consistently high grades. However, to my surprise, I have not yet received scholarship in my offer letter.

To facilitate this process, I have attached all the necessary documents and information, including my academic transcripts, recommendation letters, and any other required materials.

I am committed to continuing my academic journey and making the most of the opportunities that this scholarship would provide. Your support in reexamining my application would be greatly appreciated.

I look forward to your prompt response and hope for a positive resolution to this matter. Please feel free to reach out if you require any further information or documentation from my end.

Respected sir/madam,

Application No: 11876361
Student Name: Muzammil Hussain Syed
Course: Master of Professional Engineering (EN55)
Major : Civil Engineering
Intake: Autumn 2024

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Syed Muzammil Hussain, and I am writing to express my gratitude for the opportunity to pursue my Masters in Professional Engineering (EN55) at Queensland University of Technology, Gardens Point. It is an honor to have been offered a place in the program.

I am excited about the prospect of studying at your esteemed institution; however, I am facing financial challenges as an international student from India. Due to the cost of tuition, living expenses, and other associated costs, it would be extremely helpful for me to secure a scholarship to support my education.

I would like to request your consideration for a scholarship to assist with the financial aspects of my studies. I believe that with the help of a scholarship, I can fully dedicate myself to my academic pursuits and make the most of the learning opportunities provided by your university.

I am committed to academic excellence and have a strong track record of performance in my previous studies. I am confident that I can contribute positively to the university community. Being granted a scholarship would make a significant difference in my ability to focus on my studies and succeed in my chosen field.

If there are any specific scholarship programs available for international students in the field of Master of Professional Engineering (EN55), I kindly request information on how I can apply or be considered for such opportunities.

I understand the competitive nature of scholarship applications and appreciate your time and consideration of my request. I am happy to provide any additional documentation or information that may be required to evaluate my candidacy for a scholarship.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to your response. Please feel free to contact me if you need any further details or have any questions.

Sincerely,

Syed Muzammil Hussain

Hi Solomon,

It’s exciting to hear that you are considering studying engineering with QUT! In order to best assist you I will need to ask you some clarifying questions:


  *   Are you interested in studying a full degree such as the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)?
  *   Are you already studying engineering or another course at an overseas institution?

I am more than happy to help you with your question once you have replied to this email with more information.

Kind regards,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Sharath Badrinath and I am writing to express my concern regarding the status of my application for the Master's in Information Technology program at Queensland University of Technology.

I submitted my application approximately two months ago and, regrettably, I have not yet received my offer letter. As the February intake is rapidly approaching, I am eager to initiate the necessary preparations for the upcoming semester.

I understand that various factors contribute to the application review process, and I appreciate the efforts of the admissions team. However, given the proximity of the February intake, I kindly request your assistance in expediting the processing of my application and issuing the offer letter at the earliest convenience.

I am enthusiastic about the prospect of joining QUT and am keen to commence my studies in Information Technology.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and your understanding of the time sensitivity involved. I look forward to your prompt response and guidance on the next steps.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Sharath Badrinath

Hi Emil,

Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Alie and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.

If you have completed a degree in English, in an approved English-speaking country this can certainly be considered towards meeting the English language proficiency requirement for the QUT program. Approved English-speaking countries are Australia, Canada, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa, United States of America and Wales. To have your qualifications assessed, you will need to submit a formal application with your supporting documents to be considered for English language exemption based on prior studies completed in English.

If you have not completed prior learning in an approved English-speaking country, you can still apply without an English proficiency test and our admissions team can assess your application for an English language exemption. Please note this may result in application processing delays.

Applying to QUT
Applying is easy! Just head to our Application Portal<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/InternationalApplyNow__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!FcwgwXzXF0wQoHY-u-CtqhxP9jsHWMZSmOT8AaP9zynPu8zelmYYc3YEZL2-xAuR2Zj6SGnB5ScGs9oIOMPU$> and create an account. From there, you'll be able to start your application process. Don't forget to include all the necessary documents like your high school completion certificate/academic transcripts, English language proficiency test results, and passport identity page. We look forward to reviewing your application!

I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!FcwgwXzXF0wQoHY-u-CtqhxP9jsHWMZSmOT8AaP9zynPu8zelmYYc3YEZL2-xAuR2Zj6SGnB5ScGs6fifCgN$>.

Dear Sir,

It’s my pleasure to inform you that I would like to study biotechnology at your world-renowned Queensland University of Technology as an undergraduate student.

I am a Bangladeshi student who completed the Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) examination this year, in February 2023. In my Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC), my results are respectively GPA 5 and 4.17 out of GPA 5.

With the blessings of the internet and my teachers in schools and colleges, I came to know that the universities of the Australia provide high-quality education to students. Besides, Australia is one of the pioneers in education and technology in the world. So, I have decided to learn biotechnology at a world-class university from Australia. As I want to be a biotechnologist, I believe that after completing my study in biotechnology at Queensland University of Technology I will be able to become a world-known biotechnologist and enlighten the world with my light of knowledge as well as serve the humankind selflessly.

I have visited the website of Queensland University of Technology. There are so many photos of the beautiful campus and student activities of Queensland University of Technology. All of those have attracted me to study at Queensland University of Technology. Moreover, the university is located in Queensland, which is good, and the weather is also suitable for me.

I would be highly pleased if you could please provide me with the following information:

  1.  Admission requirements for undergraduate admission in biotechnology .

  2.  Admission procedures.

  3.  Course details.

  4.  Can I select multiple subjects in the admission form or change my course after admission?

  5.  Sessions/application start and deadline.

  6.  Do international students have to take any particular test?

  7.  Eligibility for getting a scholarship.

  8.  Which extracurricular activities are recommended?

  9.  Admission application fees (and the way of waive this fee, if possible)

  10. Admission fees.

  11. Total semesters and tuition fee for each semester

  12. Do I have to send any money to the university after getting the offer letter?

  13. How much funding do I need to show for a student visa?

  14. Permission to work elsewhere to manage tuition fees.

  15. Facilities for international students.

  16. Recommend an expert or a professor who can guide me in this situation (please, include his/ her email address).

  17. Other information, if you think to include it, will help me get more ideas.

I have contacted Australia embassy officials in Dhaka. They have informed me that if I can get admitted to a Australian university, the embassy will issue me a student visa.

I have attached copies of my SSC, HSC, and other additional transcripts and documents with this email.

It would be a great pleasure for me if you sent me an email with detailed information about whether I am eligible or not. My detailed information is given below. I am looking forward to getting a reply from you.

Sincerely yours,

Mohammod Soaib Hasan Alvi

Hi team,

Can you please assist this domestic student with their enquiry.

I have gotten my diploma in Construction Management from Deakin College/University, where the Diploma is used to fast track you into the second year of the University Degree. I have since then relocated to Brisbane and would like to see if the Diploma would carry over to QUT.

Please respond directly to the student.

Thanks,

Morgan

Dear Sir/Ma'am

I got a conditional offer that mentioned I should provide IELTS score. I asked my agency to check the uploaded documents because I have the score as below:

R 6.5
L 6
S 6
W 6
Overall 6

As you can see, I pass the requirements in each skill, but the overall (it is 6 instead of 6.5).
Is there any way to accept this score and change my offer to unconditional? Otherwise, could I enter an English course before the main course?

I am Meegha Jerry, a student from India. I've applied to study Master of nursing- (entry to practice) program in QUT. My QUT student number is 11817429.
On July 13, 2023, I received the conditional offer letter, and I submitted all of the required documents.The agency advised me that until I had the unconditional offer letter, I couldn't submit my SOP and financial documents. It wasn't until November that I received the unconditional offer. That does, however, state that I can only begin my studies in 2025. I applied for the February 2024 intake, and THE CONDITIONAL offer letter specifically states that the course begins on February 26, 2024.Upon inquiry into the reason behind the 2024 commencement year switch to 2025 ,i discovered that I will not be able to enrol in my course in 2024 as seats are already filled.

Having applied early this year, as well as promptly responding to the conditional offer letter by accepting it and submitting all the necessary documents, I don't think it's fair that I have to wait so long to receive an unconditional offer letter stating that I can only start in 2025 .with all due respect, I felt that this was unjust and that I deserve the opportunity to study in 2024.It is impossible for me to wait until 2025 to enroll in this course as I'll have a long academic gap and negatively affect me in various ways.

I might be just one among the numerous students that apply in your university. However, for me, this is my ideal course and university, this is my life.I've spent the last few months getting acquainted with the fundamentals of human biology in order to be a top student at your university. Becoming a student at QUT is my dream and the most important thing to me. I genuinely believe that I will contribute positively to your university. If I can only enrol in the course in 2025, I sadly won’t be able to study at QUT. If I can only enrol in the course in 2025, I sadly won't be able to study at my dream university QUT.
With a heavy heart and much hope, I humbly request that you grant me the chance to enrol in my desired course in 2024. Could you please kindly change my commencement year from 2025 to 2024 and assess my application for 2024.
Eagerly and anxiously awaiting your favourable reply.


Thank you.

I am Meegha Jerry, a student from India. I've applied to study Master of nursing- (entry to practice) program in QUT. My QUT student number is 11817429.
On July 13, 2023, I received the conditional offer letter, and I submitted all of the required documents.The agency advised me that until I had the unconditional offer letter, I couldn't submit my SOP and financial documents. It wasn't until November that I received the unconditional offer. That does, however, state that I can only begin my studies in 2025. I applied for the February 2024 intake, and THE CONDITIONAL offer letter specifically states that the course begins on February 26, 2024.Upon inquiry into the reason behind the 2024 commencement year switch to 2025 ,i discovered that I will not be able to enrol in my course in 2024 as seats are already filled.

Having applied early this year, as well as promptly responding to the conditional offer letter by accepting it and submitting all the necessary documents, I don't think it's fair that I have to wait so long to receive an unconditional offer letter stating that I can only start in 2025 .with all due respect, I felt that this was unjust and that I deserve the opportunity to study in 2024.It is impossible for me to wait until 2025 to enroll in this course as I'll have a long academic gap and negatively affect me in various ways.

I might be just one among the numerous students that apply in your university. However, for me, this is my ideal course and university, this is my life.I've spent the last few months getting acquainted with the fundamentals of human biology in order to be a top student at your university. Becoming a student at QUT is my dream and the most important thing to me. I genuinely believe that I will contribute positively to your university. If I can only enrol in the course in 2025, I sadly won’t be able to study at QUT. If I can only enrol in the course in 2025, I sadly won't be able to study at my dream university QUT.

With a heavy heart and much hope, I humbly request that you grant me the chance to enrol in my desired course in 2024. Could you please kindly change my commencement year from 2025 to 2024 and assess my application for 2024.

Greetings,

Sending this email inquiring about a query related to transfer of credits to QUT from a University in Calgary, Canada.

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Management Major in Finance at University of Lethbridge Calgary Campus started in Fall (September) 2023.

I would like to know if there is an option to transfer the credits which I’ll be receiving upon completing one year at University of Lethbridge to the prestigious Queensland University of Technology.

I had also received an offer letter from QUT for 'BS05 Bachelor in Business' but unfortunately I couldn't accept it in the time due to my passport renewal issue at that time.

I hope you’ll look forward to the matter and revert back to me with a response accordingly.


Thanks & Regards,

Sincerely,

Ishan Kakade.

Dear QUT Administration,
I hope this email finds you well. I previously applied from Pakistan (Application No: 6486157), where a QUT representative was required. But unfortunately my English requirement was not completed at that time. Now, residing in China, I can't find a representative here, and China is not on the list requiring one. Could you confirm if I need a representative for a new application from China?
Thank you,
Best regards,

Dear sir/madam,

I was quite hopeful of getting at least the entrance scholarship to support my study expenses while studying in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. But, I felt depressed when I saw I wasn't rewarded with the scholarship from this university.

I would be obliged if the university authority could consider my situation and provide me with the entrance scholarship to start my career there in no time.

Without getting this scholarship, I would fail to bear my study expenses and other living costs, especially the tuition fees throughout my duration of study. I will struggle badly to manage the tuition fees because I'm financially incapable to begin my study there without this scholarship.

Will be waiting for a better response from you as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
Shuvashis Biswas

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Syed Muzammil Hussain, and I am writing to request a review and verification of my scholarship eligibility for the Scholarship for the upcoming academic year.


I am excited to inform you that I have met all the specified eligibility criteria for this prestigious international scholarship, including maintaining excellent academic performance with consistently high grades. However, to my surprise, I have not yet received scholarship in my offer letter.

I kindly request your assistance in reevaluating my scholarship application and verifying my profile. I believe that there may have been an oversight or some issue in the process, and I am eager to ensure that I receive the scholarship I am eligible for.

To facilitate this process, I have attached all the necessary documents and information, including my academic transcripts, recommendation letters, and any other required materials.

I am committed to continuing my academic journey and making the most of the opportunities that this scholarship would provide. Your support in reexamining my application would be greatly appreciated.

I look forward to your prompt response and hope for a positive resolution to this matter. Please feel free to reach out if you require any further information or documentation from my end.

Respected sir/madam,

Application No: 11876361
Student Name: Muzammil Hussain Syed
Course: Master of Professional Engineering (EN55)
Major : Civil Engineering
Intake: Autumn 2024

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Syed Muzammil Hussain, and I am writing to express my gratitude for the opportunity to pursue my Masters in Professional Engineering (EN55) at Queensland University of Technology, Gardens Point. It is an honor to have been offered a place in the program.

I am excited about the prospect of studying at your esteemed institution; however, I am facing financial challenges as an international student from India. Due to the cost of tuition, living expenses, and other associated costs, it would be extremely helpful for me to secure a scholarship to support my education.

I would like to request your consideration for a scholarship to assist with the financial aspects of my studies. I believe that with the help of a scholarship, I can fully dedicate myself to my academic pursuits and make the most of the learning opportunities provided by your university.

I am committed to academic excellence and have a strong track record of performance in my previous studies. I am confident that I can contribute positively to the university community. Being granted a scholarship would make a significant difference in my ability to focus on my studies and succeed in my chosen field.

If there are any specific scholarship programs available for international students in the field of Master of Professional Engineering (EN55), I kindly request information on how I can apply or be considered for such opportunities.

I understand the competitive nature of scholarship applications and appreciate your time and consideration of my request. I am happy to provide any additional documentation or information that may be required to evaluate my candidacy for a scholarship.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to your response. Please feel free to contact me if you need any further details or have any questions.

Sincerely,

Syed Muzammil Hussain

Hi Autakorn,

Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Morgan and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.

If you have completed a degree in English, in an approved English-speaking country this can certainly be considered towards meeting the English language proficiency requirement for the QUT program. Approved English-speaking countries are Australia, Canada, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa, United States of America and Wales. To have your qualifications assessed, you will need to submit a formal application with your supporting documents to be considered for English language exemption based on prior studies completed in English.

For specific English Language requirements, check the Entry Requirements tab on the course page. You can select the Unites States and view the qualifications you must have completed to be eligible for an exemption.

I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!BcikLneh5kGat94b5nPSUxO_tAT1YVHL7r9hUz9S2IHCkU6_IL8T-QcsHgYtEGeZ9VJDCQxtMBLbteTeXW_FgJ8$>.

Hi Selena,

Following our chat today, I have reached out to the study abroad and exchange team regarding your internship query for an international applicant, and they should be in touch.

The first port of call would be your faculty work integrated learning team; however, if they are not able to assist, the study abroad and exchange team should be able to answer your queries.

You can contact them at stae@qut.edu.au<mailto:stae@qut.edu.au> or 3138 4300.

Kind regards,
Alie

Let me tell you about my experience.
Hi Adeline,

My name is Vine and two years ago I was right where you are now – deciding which university to trust with my future.

After receiving offers to study at three different universities, I was struggling to choose which one to accept. There were so many factors to consider like educational culture and areas of expertise, so after researching and asking lots of questions to all three universities, I chose QUT – the university for the real world.

During my two years studying at QUT, I was constantly impressed by how QUT emphasised opportunities that integrated knowledge and learnings into real, high-quality practical applications. Each project or assessment was grounded and embedded with real-world examples, giving real insight into how companies and organisations worked to solve challenges.

But it’s not all about study. I have also worked part-time in hospitality and retail, explored Brisbane, and made lots of friends. The experiences I have gained have helped me to become more independent and confident.

I understand that making the decision to study overseas is a big decision, but it’s also a brave one. My advice? Step outside your comfort zone and challenge yourself.

Best wishes on your journey to QUT!

Student's message       Hello Queensland University of Technology. I am very interested to study Diploma in Public Health. I am currently working as a Disease Control Officer in a public institution and I have faced so many public health issues. Choosing this course will be beneficial for me to serve the public health sector in the institution I am currently serving. Moreover, it will also create a pathway for me to do Masters in Public Health in the same institution. If any other related course like disease control or epidemiology that you have offered then I will be also happy to study these courses. Thank you very much.

Hello Sir/Madam,
Myself Blaize Jose Binoj, I got a COE certificate from your university confirming my enrollment. I have done the full payment through the agent to the university, after that they applied for my student visa, then i got a mail from them stating that ''The applicant did not satisfy the provisions of the Migration Regulations 1994"" which I received on 16th November 2023.The agency mentioned that I cannot apply for a student visa for the next 2 years, also I lost my visa, medical and biometric fees. Therefore, since I cannot enter into Australia, then how i can get my fees paid for the semester refunded? How long will it take to receive the amount? Will the money be transferred to my account or the agent's account? What is the main reason for the rejection of visa approval, we have submitted all the documents according to the university requirements. Can this be a possibility that the agent filled the details incorrectly or any other reason? Finally, in this manner, I lost my one year of study and it mentally affected myself and got me into a stage of depression. Hereby, it is a request from my side, to please refund my fees I paid as soon as possible. 🙏. Will I get the full amount back i paid to the university?

Yours Faithfully
Thanking You,
Blaize Jose Binoj.

Furthermore, I have attached all my documents please check it out. Hereby, I am expecting a response very soon. 🙏",TRUE,2024-05-29T10:08:12.000+0821,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,India,<p>Made offer international student - agent assisted</p>,,,E&A,,"Fees, costs and scholarships",Response Given,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,Tuition fees

Dear QUT Admissions Office/International Student Services,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Danny Ikija, and I am writing to express my keen interest in pursuing a Bachelor's degree in either Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, or Architectural and Building at Queensland University of Technology.

I am particularly drawn to QUT due to its esteemed reputation and commitment to excellence in engineering and architectural education. Before I proceed with the application process, I would like to inquire about the tuition costs associated with these programs for international students.

Additionally, if there are any specific scholarships, financial aid options, or application deadlines that I should be aware of, please provide that information as well.

I understand that studying abroad involves various aspects, and I am committed to preparing thoroughly for the application process. Any guidance or information you can provide will be immensely valuable in helping me plan for this significant step in my academic journey.

Thank you very much for your time and assistance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Warm regards,

Danny Ikija

Hi Morgan ,
i would like to apply , but i was considering the academic scholarship which offers :


These scholarships will be paid as a study stipend of up to $5,000 after the HECS-HELP census date of each semester for up to three years ($10,000 per year).

  *   scholarships valued at $10,000 each for study in any discipline.

how can i apply or be elegible also how much my semester would end considering that my associate degree at TAFE got credits as well that i probably dont need to take it at QUT.

i would like to make this as soon as possible .

Regards ,
Julian

Asunto: Thank you for your enquiry about studying at QUT!






[Text    Description automatically generated with low confidence]











Hi Julian,



Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Morgan and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.



Credit for prior learning

To be considered for credit towards your QUT course and be able to graduate sooner, you will need to include additional supporting documents with your application. This includes:



  *   your official academic transcript showing the unit code(s), unit title(s) and grade(s) achieved
  *   documents proving that you have completed your course, such as a completion certificate
  *   unit outlines or course syllabus of the unit(s) you are wanting credit for.



There is a question within the application called “Do you wish to be considered for Advanced Standing based on your previous studies?”. You will need to select ‘Yes’ to this question.



Once you have finished and submitted your application, our international admission team will consider your request for advanced standing. Details of the credit awarded and the potential reduction in course duration will be listed in your QUT offer letter. We cannot pre-assess credit – you must apply to QUT with your supporting documents for consideration.



You can search for previously approved units<https://www.advancedstanding.qut.edu.au/cgi-bin/WebObjects/AdvStand.woa> for credit on the Advanced Standing Precedent List.



Applying to QUT

When you’re ready to apply, head to our Application Portal<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/InternationalApplyNow__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!C98BojIyggo-5VFh-7iYeiceXty2BHSGEfHV9-noIXIKyvbmDcCQAWT0LTSTazOoUVm6glp0gf5dPG6HharoZoH27Ung2t1Jdw$> and create an account. From there, you'll be able to start your application process. Don't forget to include all the necessary documents like your high school completion certificate/academic transcripts, English language proficiency test results, and passport identity page. We look forward to reviewing your application!



Scholarships

All international applicants are automatically considered for the International Merit Scholarship (IMS) once an application has been submitted. The IMS award offers a 25% reduction in tuition fees for the first year of your course at QUT.



For eligible courses only, an ongoing award of 25% per semester may be offered to students who continue to meet the GPA requirement.



For more information, please visit the International Merit Scholarship<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/fees-and-scholarships/scholarships/international-merit-scholarship> webpage.



I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!C98BojIyggo-5VFh-7iYeiceXty2BHSGEfHV9-noIXIKyvbmDcCQAWT0LTSTazOoUVm6glp0gf5dPG6HharoZoH27UlSYszP5g$>.

Good morning,

I am applying at QUT as an international student for a Master of Early Childhood Teaching. I am trying to plan a budget and I have a few questions.
Regarding the tuition fees, I understand that the first semester has to be paid as soon as I enrol in the course. What about the rest of the tuition fees? Do I pay monthly? Weekly? What are the options?

Regarding the professional placement during the degree program, is it a paid placement? Will I receive an income?

Are there any student discounts available for buses and trains (I live on the sunshine coast)?

I had also a couple of questions regarding the following visa (after graduation, Post Graduate Visa 485), would you be able to put me in touch with an international student who has graduated and is still in the country, who might be able to answer my questions?



Thank you so much for your help.
Have a good day.
Kind regards,

Louise

[Students at QUT]

Let me tell you about my experience.



Hi Edward,

My name is Vine and two years ago I was right where you are now – deciding which university to trust with my future.

After receiving offers to study at three different universities, I was struggling to choose which one to accept. There were so many factors to consider like educational culture and areas of expertise, so after researching and asking lots of questions to all three universities, I chose QUT – the university for the real world.

During my two years studying at QUT, I was constantly impressed by how QUT emphasised opportunities that integrated knowledge and learnings into real, high-quality practical applications. Each project or assessment was grounded and embedded with real-world examples, giving real insight into how companies and organisations worked to solve challenges.

But it’s not all about study. I have also worked part-time in hospitality and retail, explored Brisbane, and made lots of friends. The experiences I have gained have helped me to become more independent and confident.

I understand that making the decision to study overseas is a big decision, but it’s also a brave one. My advice? Step outside your comfort zone and challenge yourself.

Best wishes on your journey to QUT!

Vine
Master of Business (Marketing), China

Hi Pamela,

Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Alie and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.

Our portal is open all year round, so you can apply at any time.

We recommend applying at least 4 months in advance of the start date to allow enough time for applying for a visa (if required).

The application closing date for students not in Australia is typically 4 weeks before the start of class. For Semester 1, 2024 this date is the 29 January.

Our Bachelor of Design (Fashion)<https://www.qut.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-design-fashion> commences inFebruary, July of each academic year and runs for 3 years full-time from our Kelvin Grove campus. The international tuition fee is approximately $35,200 per year full-time (2024 AUD fees).

To view the entry requirements<https://www.qut.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-design-fashion?international#requirements>, visit the course page and scroll down to the ‘Explore this course’ section and click on the ‘Requirements’ tab. Use the drop-down menu to select your country to view the qualification requirements. If your country or qualifications are not listed, you can still apply for this course and our international admission team will assess your eligibility once you have submitted a formal application. We cannot pre-assess qualifications.

Applying to QUT
Applying is easy!

From there, you'll be able to start your application process. Don't forget to include all the necessary documents like your high school completion certificate/academic transcripts, English language proficiency test results, and passport identity page. We look forward to reviewing your application!

I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!GK-ypn19fv0mA-hhVqY71xwSw8bg18aHxyB5-GRvAISqtsIBRUsesu6yltqGoCdODjAdKdIDRJNI5d2vzWF_47rYMbabtrdwIw$>.

Subject: Admission intuitions for fashion design

I hope this message finds you well. I'm an aspiring fashion design student from Chile, and I'm very interested in your Fashion Design program. I have a few questions about the application process and tuition costs, and I'm wondering if it's possible to schedule a Zoom or online meeting for further clarification.
Specifically, I'd like to know about the application requirements and deadlines for international students from Chile, as well as any specific documentation needed. Additionally, I'm interested in understanding the tuition fees for the program or if there are any scholarships or financial aid options available.
Your assistance in clarifying these matters would be greatly appreciated as I consider pursuing my passion for fashion at your university. I'm looking forward to your response and any guidance you can provide.

My best regards

Here's how to accept and join us at QUT
Accepting your offer to study will be exciting and a little daunting at first. Here is a list of what happens next so you can feel prepared and ready to take on this next journey with confidence.

  *   Meet all the conditions outlined on your offer letter and then ask your agent to accept your offer. Don't forget to pay your deposit as we won't be able to process your acceptance until we have received your payment. You'll need to contact your agent to complete this step.
  *   We will aim to process your acceptance within 5 business days and provide your agent with your Confirmation of Enrolment Certificate (eCOE).
  *   When you are accepted, you can access a whole range of great resources to get you started at QUT, including enrolment guides, class registration instructions, timetable planning, support and more!

Dear Sir/madam,

Application No: 11876361
Student Name: Muzammil Hussain Syed
Course: Master of Professional Engineering (EN55)
Major : Civil Engineering
Intake: Autumn 2024


I hope this email finds you well. My name is Syed Muzammil Hussain, and I am writing to request a review and verification of my scholarship eligibility for the Scholarship for the upcoming academic year.


I am excited to inform you that I have met all the specified eligibility criteria for this prestigious international scholarship, including maintaining excellent academic performance with consistently high grades. However, to my surprise, I have not yet received scholarship in my offer letter.

I kindly request your assistance in reevaluating my scholarship application and verifying my profile. I believe that there may have been an oversight or some issue in the process, and I am eager to ensure that I receive the scholarship I am eligible for.

To facilitate this process, I have attached all the necessary documents and information, including my academic transcripts, recommendation letters, and any other required materials.

I am committed to continuing my academic journey and making the most of the opportunities that this scholarship would provide. Your support in reexamining my application would be greatly appreciated.

I look forward to your prompt response and hope for a positive resolution to this matter. Please feel free to reach out if you require any further information or documentation from my end.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Syed Muzammil Hussain

Dear Admissions Committee,

I trust this message finds you well. I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for the conditional offer extended to me for the Master's program at QUT (Queensland University of Technology). The prospect of contributing to your esteemed institution's academic community is truly exciting.

In light of the conditional offer, I respectfully request a waiver of the IELTS test score requirement for my application. My academic and professional background reflects a robust command of the English language, positioning me for success in the Master's program.

Having pursued my undergraduate studies in Australia, I immersed myself in an English-speaking environment and achieved academic excellence. Currently enrolled in the Master's program in Healthcare Administration at Saudi Electronic University, I have further refined my English language skills through an exclusively English-medium curriculum, as confirmed by an official letter from the institution.

Furthermore, my seven years of dedicated experience as a healthcare professional have involved extensive communication in English with colleagues, patients, and stakeholders. This professional journey has not only enriched my linguistic abilities but has also equipped me to engage in complex discussions, meticulously document medical records, and seamlessly provide patient care in an English-speaking work environment.

Considering the depth of my academic and professional experiences, I kindly request the Admissions Committee at QUT to consider waiving the IELTS test score requirement, acknowledging my demonstrated proficiency in the English language.

In addition to the waiver request, I express my eagerness for the conversion of my conditional offer into an unconditional one. I am confident that my background aligns seamlessly with the expectations of the Master's program at QUT, and I am fully committed to contributing meaningfully to this academic endeavor.

Thank you for dedicating your time to consider my request. I look forward with enthusiasm to the prospect of contributing to the QUT community and the opportunity to immerse myself in the Master's program.

Warm regards,

Saad Alsufayyan

Hi Atufa,

Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Morgan and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.

Our portal is open all year round, so you can apply at any time and applications can take up to 30 days for assessment.

We recommend applying at least 4 months in advance of the start date to allow enough time for applying for a visa (if required).

The application closing date for students not in Australia is typically 4 weeks before the start of classes. For Semester 1, 2024 this date is 22 January 2024.

I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!GOTEikmDeRlSbKoG9EBs2VaYqNfOqnWGBw5Q_KAgqJNxsy2zvczx4O3jsFXztAmT0MAA6tdFGBcg6YE2mggCzaVWtQ$>.

Hi Quinn,

Herewith the amended COD form for your reference and I am applying to renew my international passport from HK Immigration Department but it may takes at least 1+ week to have the new one back. On the other hand, HKIA already chasing me the application stauts, so would you please help me to find a easy way for that?

Anyway, thank you very much for your help.

Kind regards,

Hi Ka Ching Dick,

Thank you for your reply and your documentation. After looking at your documents, there are two areas needing amendment.

Change to Personal Details form
Firstly, on the first page of the 'Change to Personal Details' form, you have listed your 'Current personal details' including 'Dick' in your Given names. This section is meant for what is currently in QUT's systems and should be as follows:

Family name: CHOI
Given names: KA CHING

In section 1. Change of name, this is where you will need to have the following:

New surname: CHOI
New given name/s: KA CHING DICK

Passport
Secondly, your passport will need to be certified before we can use it as proof of your identity. Your passport is also currently expired as of 25 September 2023.


To best support you I’ve redirected your enquiry to our Enrolment and Student Records (ESR) team to investigate if it is possible to have your HKIA completed. You are welcome to follow up your enquiry by replying to this email.

We will be back in touch soon. If you would like to follow up, please reply to this email, call us on (07) 3138 2000, visit us on campus<http://www.qut.edu.au/student-centres> or start an online chat.<http://www.qut.edu.au/student-centres>

Hi Ka Ching Dick,

Thank you for your reply.

As you can see on your HKID and your parchment, you are missing 'Dick' as part of your Given Name. In this instance, you will need to complete the 'Change to Personal Details' form. You will need to certify one of the listed documents on this form e.g. International Passport.

I believe this is all the information you’ll need to get started but if you have any further questions, please reply to this email, call us on (07) 3138 2000, visit us on campus<http://www.qut.edu.au/student-centres> or start an online chat<http://www.qut.edu.au/student-centres>.

Hi Ka Ching Dick,

Thank you for your reply.

As you can see on your HKID and your parchment, you are missing 'Dick' as part of your Given Name. In this instance, you will need to complete the 'Change to Personal Details' form. You will need to certify one of the listed documents on this form e.g. International Passport.

I believe this is all the information you’ll need to get started but if you have any further questions, please reply to this email, call us on (07) 3138 2000, visit us on campus<http://www.qut.edu.au/student-centres> or start an online chat<http://www.qut.edu.au/student-centres>.

Response By Email (Jessica) (18/11/2023 09.53 AM)


Hi Anupriya,

Thanks so much for your email. I can certainly help with your enquiry regarding admission pathways.

For domestic students who are interested in studying an undergraduate degree and who do not have an ATAR, a selection rank can be used in order to assess eligibility for a course. When course offers are made, selection ranks and ATARs are treated equally, and selection ranks can be obtained a number of ways.

Below I have provided some general information on these admission pathways for you. You may also like to look over our online Admission pathways booklet<https://cms.qut.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/252021/qut-admission-pathways-guide.pdf> for further information.

Entry Based on Secondary Education
Year 12 results don't expire after you finish school. They are converted to a selection rank and you can continue to use them to get into university in the future. If you completed any of the following, your experience there can be translated into a selection rank, which can then be used to gain entry into a course:

  *
An International Baccalaureate Diploma (IBD)
  *
A vocational education and training (VET) qualification completed at school (certificate IV or above)
  *
Seventh grade AMEB (or higher) or equivalent qualifications.

You may like to look over our Recent secondary education<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/applying/recent-secondary-education> page for more information if this is relevant to you.

Vocational Education and Training (VET) Study
VET study can provide a great foundation for future study at QUT.  To be considered for entry to degree courses you can use an Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) award completed at TAFE or a private education provider, including:

  *
Certificate IV
  *
Diploma
  *
Advanced diploma.

Completion of VET studies can then be used to translate into a selection rank, which can then be used to gain entry into a course. Please note that a certificate III can only be used to gain entry into a QUT Diploma, and not an undergraduate course.

I would recommend having a look over our VET study<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/applying/vet-study> page for more information on this admission pathway and to see how these studies can translate into a selection rank.

Work and Life Experience
Work and life experience can be assessed in order to obtain a selection rank, which can then be used to gain entry into a course. This selection rank will be based on your professional qualifications, paid employment, or past school results.

I would recommend having a look at our Work and life experience<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/applying/work-and-life-experience> page for more information on this admission pathway.

Applying

Enquiry: Are there scholarships for Filipinos like me? I am currently a Head Teacher in the Philippines and a holder of a Master's Degree in Teaching Physics. I'd like to pursue a Doctor of Education degree. However, with a very meager salary, I couldn't afford to enroll in one. Furthermore, without a Doctorate degree, promotion to a better position is difficult here in the Philippines.

Hello, I am a Korean high school student living in Korea who wants to go to QUT University in Australia and wants to enter the law-related department. I currently have a Korean passport and am implementing a curriculum in Korea.
What I'm curious about is, in order to enter QUT high school, do I have to enter QUT with the results of my last exam to go to college at Korean high school? Or do I just have to graduate from Korean high school and take the additional test required by QUT?

Student's message       My name is Bilal, and I reside in Pakistan. I pursued my education within the borders of my homeland. In 2020, I completed my matriculation from a private school, achieving a commendable 69.6% in my academic endeavors. Subsequently, I obtained my intermediate degree in 2022 from a private institution in Pakistan, attaining a score of 55.6%. Currently, I am enrolled in a computer science program at a local private university. While this institution has provided me with valuable opportunities, I aspire to elevate my educational experience to a global standard. It is my fervent desire to enroll in Queensland University of Technology (QUT), renowned for its cutting-edge technology and exceptional support for students, ensuring a trajectory toward excellence. I harbor a profound ambition to further my education at Queensland University of Technology (QUT)), envisioning it as a pivotal step towards a brighter future. By conveying my aspirations, I hope to elucidate my earnest intentions and aspirations for a comprehensive understanding.

Hi Miki,

Great to hear from you and I’m glad to hear you’re interested in study at QUT! My name is Morgan and I'm here to help answer any questions you may have.

Once you have submitted an application to study at QUT, you will automatically be considered for the International Merit Scholarship. You do not need to provide any additional documents.

You can explore all our scholarship options on our Scholarships website<https://www.qut.edu.au/study/fees-and-scholarships/scholarships/browse?study-level_key=Any&student-type_key=CURRENT&study-area-broad_key=Health&eligibility-citizenship_key=INT&eligibility-criteria_key=Any&query=>. There are over 50 scholarships available to International students based on different eligibility criteria so your best option is to look through the available scholarships and apply for those you believe you are eligible for.

I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!AHw1HacrPfG46QQQ4y0N50Xg56VQ4dVikagXYxRV5MSk6mELozjP5EG4dkTVvMfH2mfyhJxe3MjZJXuKOerq7g$>.

Hi Miki,

Thank you for your enquiry and congratulations on receiving an offer to study at QUT. My name is Morgan and I can help answer any questions you have.

You will select your major when you enrol in your units in your first semester.

Congratulations on receiving the scholarship! Your total tuition and acceptance deposit will be reduced with the scholarship amount. The $12,750 acceptance deposit has already been reduced based on your scholarship. This deposit covers your first semester of study at QUT. You will need to pay your fees upfront again at the start of your second semester.

The acceptance deadline is generally 2 weeks before the start of the semester, however we suggest accepting as soon as possible so that you can begin organising your visa, accommodation and get ready to move to Australia to study. The exact date has not yet been confirmed.

I believe I have answered all your questions but if you need additional support, you can reply to this email, call us, chat with us, or book a call back<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/bit.ly/3LtsKxj__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!FnP-lqOV6eSFR4oLtTOiVYqLTof1UQ6xHWmTtkXmEsw4qP7fl-FRjmJ7dMNc9afGlfV6Mc6xVDik3Y6mGl4LJA$>.

Hello,

My name is Miki.

Thank you for giving me an unconditional offer to study Master of Business at QUT in Semester1, 2024. I'm so glad to hear that.

Could you please confirm the following question?

① I have a question about the course.
    Offer letter says I could study the course below
    and I would like to select the major of marketing.
    When will I choose a major?
    Is it almost possible to learn the major I request?


    Course: BS11 Master of Business
    CRICOS course code: 085448J

②  I have a question about the scholarship.
      I'm honored to be awarded the QUT International Merit Scholarship.
      Will it be automatically adapted when I accept my offer?
      Also, am I correct in understanding that
      I will pay $25,500 (25% of tuition fee) for the annual tuition fee?

③  I have a question about the deposit.
     Will I pay $12,750 for deposit applied scholarship?
     Also, will it be part of the first year tuition annual fee?

④  About the deadline for accepting the offer, could you give me the information?
     I checked the key dates sites but I couldn't find the specific deadline.

Hi Quinn,

Herewith the amended COD form for your reference and I am applying to renew my international passport from HK Immigration Department but it may takes at least 1+ week to have the new one back. On the other hand, HKIA already chasing me the application stauts, so would you please help me to find a easy way for that?

Anyway, thank you very much for your help.

Hi Ka Ching Dick,

Thank you for your reply and your documentation. After looking at your documents, there are two areas needing amendment.

Change to Personal Details form
Firstly, on the first page of the 'Change to Personal Details' form, you have listed your 'Current personal details' including 'Dick' in your Given names. This section is meant for what is currently in QUT's systems and should be as follows:

Family name: CHOI
Given names: KA CHING

In section 1. Change of name, this is where you will need to have the following:

New surname: CHOI
New given name/s: KA CHING DICK

Passport
Secondly, your passport will need to be certified before we can use it as proof of your identity. Your passport is also currently expired as of 25 September 2023.


To best support you I’ve redirected your enquiry to our Enrolment and Student Records (ESR) team to investigate if it is possible to have your HKIA completed. You are welcome to follow up your enquiry by replying to this email.

We will be back in touch soon. If you would like to follow up, please reply to this email, call us on (07) 3138 2000, visit us on campus<http://www.qut.edu.au/student-centres> or start an online chat.<http://www.qut.edu.au/student-centres>

Hi Ka Ching Dick,

Thank you for your reply.

As you can see on your HKID and your parchment, you are missing 'Dick' as part of your Given Name. In this instance, you will need to complete the 'Change to Personal Details' form. You will need to certify one of the listed documents on this form e.g. International Passport.

I believe this is all the information you’ll need to get started but if you have any further questions, please reply to this email, call us on (07) 3138 2000, visit us on campus<http://www.qut.edu.au/student-centres> or start an online chat<http://www.qut.edu.au/student-centres>.

Hi Ka Ching Dick,

Thank you for your reply.

As you can see on your HKID and your parchment, you are missing 'Dick' as part of your Given Name. In this instance, you will need to complete the 'Change to Personal Details' form. You will need to certify one of the listed documents on this form e.g. International Passport.

I believe this is all the information you’ll need to get started but if you have any further questions, please reply to this email, call us on (07) 3138 2000, visit us on campus<http://www.qut.edu.au/student-centres> or start an online chat<http://www.qut.edu.au/student-centres>.

Good luck with your application!

Hi Choi,

Thank you for your email regarding verification of studies, I have gathered the below information to assist you.

Based on the information you have provided, you may be interested in the Verification of studies<https://www.qut.edu.au/engage/industry-and-partnerships/work-with-students/verification-of-studies> service. The hardcopy verification process is a paid service, but you will be able to outline the additional documentation you are requiring i.e. the specific HKIA form to be completed alongside the verification.

Before paying for the service however, you are welcome to send the HKIA form in response to this email. I am happy to redirect your enquiry to the Enrolment and Student Records (ESR) team so they can investigate if they are able to complete your request before you pay for anything.

Thanks for emailing us at HiQ.

To whom it may concern,

I'm writing this mail with the joy of receiving an unconditional offer letter from Qut but, sadly, you haven't considered me for your scholarship program.

I would like to put forward a request for consideration for a scholarship which will be a great help to me during this time.

I hope to hear from you soon with a positive reply

Yours sincerely

Dear CloudStor User,

This is a reminder that AARNet is decommissioning CloudStor at 12pm AEDT on 15 December 2023. You will need to download or move your data to an alternative service<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://support.aarnet.edu.au/hc/en-us/articles/6547506369679-Download-or-migrate-data-from-CloudStor__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!CFewIEvPj3Su3S78obHIA56c4CHF0ar6j21p1dRb8HWVO95iyorbkoUpz7Tm0_mHt5Z86YEDTzSG2tN_XWU5PNPlgg-t$> before then.

From 15 December 2023 you will no longer be able to retrieve your data from CloudStor and AARNet will cease providing the CloudStor service to you, as per our terms and conditions<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.aarnet.edu.au/uploads/resources/CloudStor-End-User-service-terms-v1.1.pdf__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!CFewIEvPj3Su3S78obHIA56c4CHF0ar6j21p1dRb8HWVO95iyorbkoUpz7Tm0_mHt5Z86YEDTzSG2tN_XWU5PJTbV1Zi$>.

To help you with this process, the following two features are available in CloudStor via a web browser.

Request All My Data

The Request All My Data feature can be used to create a copy of your CloudStor data. Once your request has been processed, you will receive an email with the link to download your data.

Learn more about how to request all your data<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://support.aarnet.edu.au/hc/en-us/articles/7303040651151-Request-All-My-Data__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!CFewIEvPj3Su3S78obHIA56c4CHF0ar6j21p1dRb8HWVO95iyorbkoUpz7Tm0_mHt5Z86YEDTzSG2tN_XWU5PMPVpdx8$>

Delete My Account

You can use the Delete My Account feature to have your CloudStor account disabled and queued for removal after 15 December, 2023. Once you complete this process, you will no longer have access to CloudStor.

Learn more about how to delete your account<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://support.aarnet.edu.au/hc/en-us/articles/7302914897039-Delete-My-Account__;!!NVzLfOphnbDXSw!CFewIEvPj3Su3S78obHIA56c4CHF0ar6j21p1dRb8HWVO95iyorbkoUpz7Tm0_mHt5Z86YEDTzSG2tN_XWU5PFYkRLTi$>

Let me tell you about my experience.
Hi Barry,

My name is Vine and two years ago I was right where you are now – deciding which university to trust with my future.

After receiving offers to study at three different universities, I was struggling to choose which one to accept. There were so many factors to consider like educational culture and areas of expertise, so after researching and asking lots of questions to all three universities, I chose QUT – the university for the real world.

During my two years studying at QUT, I was constantly impressed by how QUT emphasised opportunities that integrated knowledge and learnings into real, high-quality practical applications. Each project or assessment was grounded and embedded with real-world examples, giving real insight into how companies and organisations worked to solve challenges.

But it’s not all about study. I have also worked part-time in hospitality and retail, explored Brisbane, and made lots of friends. The experiences I have gained have helped me to become more independent and confident.

I understand that making the decision to study overseas is a big decision, but it’s also a brave one. My advice? Step outside your comfort zone and challenge yourself.

Best wishes on your journey to QUT!

Vine
